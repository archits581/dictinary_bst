Leveraging tree data structure to efficiently retrieve data from a dictionary

Use the add word functionality to add new words to the dictionary
Use the remove word functionality to remove a word from the dictionary
Use the search word functionality to search a word in the dictionary

Since the data structure used is a binary search tree, the time complexity for all operations will be O(log n).
